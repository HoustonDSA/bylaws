## Section 3.1. Membership
Members of the Houston Local DSA will be those individuals whose dues to national DSA are paid in full and who reside and/or work in Harris County, TX and the surrounding, contiguous counties. It will be the responsibility of members to approve policies and guidelines for the operation of the Houston DSA, to elect delegates to the national convention, to vote on matters related to national policy, and to make recommendations on issues and other matters to the National Political Committee of DSA.

## Section 3.2. Dues
The local chapter may establish a Local pledge system of voluntary donations for its members.

## Section 3.3. Removal of Members
If a full member is found to be in substantial disagreement with the principles or policies of national DSA or strategy outlined in Article II, or if they are found to be consistently engaging in undemocratic, disruptive behavior, or advocates violence, the Local may vote to expel them from DSA.  In order for such a finding to be made, another DSA member must formally prepare written charges against the member in question to the Local Executive Committee, which shall set the date of a local meeting for deliberations on the charges.  The member in question must receive a copy of the written charges and notice of the meeting a minimum of two weeks before that meeting takes place.  Expulsion of a member or affiliate member requires a two-thirds vote of the local meeting.  An expelled full member may appeal to the National Political Committee of DSA.
