## Section 3.3. Dues
No additional dues beyond those required for national DSA membership are required for membership in Houston DSA. Houston DSA may establish a voluntary system of one-time or recurring donations for its members.

## Section 3.4. Removal of Members
If a full member is found to be in substantial disagreement with the principles or policies of national DSA or strategy outlined in Article II, or if they are found to be consistently engaging in undemocratic, disruptive behavior, or advocates violence, the Local may vote to expel them from DSA. In order for such a finding to be made, another DSA member must formally prepare written charges against the member in question to the Local Executive Committee, which shall set the date of a local meeting for deliberations on the charges. The member in question must receive a copy of the written charges and notice of the meeting a minimum of two weeks before that meeting takes place.
